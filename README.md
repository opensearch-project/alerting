# OpenSearch Alerting

The OpenSearch Alerting enables you to monitor your data and send alert notifications automatically to your stakeholders. With an intuitive OpenSearch Dashboards interface and a powerful API, it is easy to set up, manage, and monitor your alerts. Craft highly specific alert conditions using Elasticsearch's full query language and scripting capabilities.


## Highlights

Scheduled searches use [cron expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or intervals (e.g. every five minutes) and the Elasticsearch query DSL.

To define trigger conditions, use the Painless scripting language or simple thresholds (e.g. count > 100).

When trigger conditions are met, you can publish messages to the following destinations:

* [Slack](https://slack.com/)
* Custom webhook
* [Amazon Chime](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/)
* Email

Messages can be static strings, or you can use the [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) templates to include contextual information.
